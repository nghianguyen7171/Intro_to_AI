- Submit presentation and report (all .pdf files) via email or Zalo
- Awards for best presentation and best report

### Project Workflow
1. Identify a real-world problem
2. Model it as a search problem (state space search)
3. Apply at least 2–3 search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Greedy, A*, etc.)
4. Implement and test with code
5. Compare results (expanded nodes, time, solution quality)
6. Relate findings back to the real-world context

### Presentation Requirements
- **Duration:** 10–12 minutes per team
- **Structure:** Introduction, Problem Formulation, Algorithms, Experiments & Results, Discussion
- **Q&A:** Record questions and answers for "Response to Reviewers" section

### Report Structure
1. Introduction (real-world background)
2. Problem Formulation (search problem representation)
3. Algorithms (description with pseudocode)

5. Discussion (analysis and insights)
6. Response to Reviewers (Q&A from presentation)
7. Conclusion

### Project Example: 8-Puzzle
- **Theoretical:** Apply BFS, GBFS (misplaced tiles), A* (Manhattan distance)
- **Real-world:** Seat arrangement in international conference
- **Sample:** 9 chairs (8 delegates + 1 empty), diplomatic protocols

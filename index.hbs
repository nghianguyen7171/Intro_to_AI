    <h1>About This Course</h1>

    <div class="module">
        <p>This course aims to deliver a comprehensive overview of Artificial Intelligence, its implications, applications, and the skills to leverage it. The course begins by describing what the latest generation of artificial intelligence techniques can do. After an introduction to some basic concepts and techniques, the course illustrates both the potential and current limitations of these techniques with examples from a variety of applications.</p>

        <p>We spend some time on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of human decision-making and learning, specifically in combination with AI systems. Exercises will include hands-on application of basic AI techniques as well as selection of appropriate technologies for a given problem and anticipation of design implications. In a final project, groups of students will participate in the creation of a simple AI-based application.</p>

        <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> EP16.TOKT11108 (Fundamental Programming Concepts in Python)</p>

        <h3>Project Workflow:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify a real-world problem</li>
            <li>Model it as a search problem (state space search)</li>
            <li>Apply at least 2–3 search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Greedy, A*, etc.)</li>
            <li>Implement and test with code</li>
            <li>Compare results (expanded nodes, time, solution quality)</li>
            <li>Relate findings back to the real-world context</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Suggested Report Structure:</h3>

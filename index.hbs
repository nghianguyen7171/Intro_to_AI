    <h1>Assignments</h1>

    <div class="policies">
        <p><strong>Late Policy:</strong> Assignments are due at {{assignmentsFrontmatter.[Due time]}} on the date specified. You have <strong>3 late days</strong> in total which can be used throughout the semester without penalty. Once you run out of late days, each additional late day will incur a <strong>10% penalty</strong>. For example, if you submit an assignment 1 day late after using all your late days, a score of 90 will only be counted as 81. Note that the maximum late days per assignment is <strong>two days</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Collaboration Policy:</strong> You may form study groups and discuss problems with your classmates. However, you must write up the assignment solutions and the code from scratch, without referring to notes from your joint session. In your solution to each problem, you must write down the names of any person with whom you discussed the problem—this will not affect your grade.</p>

        <p><strong>Submission:</strong> Assignments should be submitted through <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>. If you have not used Gradescope before, please watch this short video: <a href="https://gradescope.com/get_started">"For students: submitting homework."</a> At the beginning of the semester, you will be added to the Gradescope class roster. This will give you access to the course page, and the assignment submission form. To submit assignments, you will need to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Upload a single PDF document containing all the math, code, plots, and exposition required for each problem.</li>
            <li> Where assignments are divided into sections, <strong>please begin each section on a new page</strong>.</li>
            <li> You will then select the appropriate page ranges for each assignment problem, as described in the "submitting homework" video.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Check <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> to get your scores on each individual problem, as well as comments on your answers.
        Regrading requests should be submitted on Gradescope.
